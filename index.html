        <p>Dubstep is a genre of electronic dance music (EDM) that is characterized by the use of irregular rhythmic patterns, with heavy basslines, and a dark nature. Dubstep songs usually have a bpm (beats per minute) ranging between 130 and 150, though they typically are around 140bpm. Originating from the United Kingdom in the early 2000s, the genre has gained notoriety and adoration from fans worldwide. Since its inception in the underground nightclubs of London, the genre has grown to include a wide variety of subgenres, each catering to the listeners specific preference and mood. Recently, attendance at dubstep concerts and festivals have reached an all-time high, adored by fans for the massive production, these performances often feature massive LED screens and a powerful array of lasers.</p>
